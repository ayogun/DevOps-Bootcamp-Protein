# Config Files

Here we have two config files in order to make neceessary settings for sending email. In order to use these config files in your machine, in sasl_passwd file, please write your email and password which you want to use to send your emails from your machine. 

## Where should I place these config files?

- `main.cf` file goes to vim `/etc/postfix/main.cf`
- `sasl_passwd` file goes to `/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd`


**PS: You don't need to use these config files if you already have email setting on your machine. Or feel free to use another configurations.**
